# Whistle Clogger

This is a tool designed to clock up https://prolifewhistleblower.com/sign-up-page/

The hope is that by creating misleading reports, this vigilante forced birther group will find their work harder to accomplish

This tool is designed to rely on ProtonVPN, and requires that `protonvpn-cli` is available on your system. This is to randomize the origin of the reports, so the site admins can't as easily filter out the data.

# Installation

Set up protonvpn, and then install the dependencies from `requirements.txt`

You need to install the geckodriver for your platform: https://github.com/mozilla/geckodriver/releases

You will also need firefox, which is the only supported browser

On a command line, you have to go into the directory, and run `pip install -r requirements.txt`

This script requires Python 3.8 or newer
